    <h1>Campeche Mexico</h1>
    <p>Campeche is one of the 32 states in Mexico. It's a beautiful place, full of colors. One of the most amazing
        things is the history behind the city. There are big walls surrounding it and also "The Malecon" a large side
        walk next to the ocean. So that makes it an excellent
        place for those who like history.</p>
